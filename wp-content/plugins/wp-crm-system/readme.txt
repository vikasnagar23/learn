WP-CRM System is a WordPress CRM that is designed to work exclusively with YOUR WordPress site.

== Description ==
WP-CRM System is a fully featured WordPress CRM that allows you to use the WordPress interface you are already familiar with to manage your customers, projects, and tasks with ease.

Why spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a CRM that charges based on the number of records you have in your database, or the number of users that you have accessing your database? WP-CRM System allows you to have an unlimited number of records and lets you give everyone in your organization access to the WordPress CRM data they need to drive business.

**More than a CRM**

WP-CRM System allows your team to manage projects, assign individual tasks, track marketing campaigns, and helps convert your opportunities into successes!

Easily import contacts and other records from your old CRM with our easy to use CSV uploader.

Get email updates whenever a project or task you are assigned to is created or edited. Never miss a thing!

Quickly create new contacts from existing users on your site with just one click. The plugin will take existing information (name, email address, etc.) from the user's account and add it to the new contact in WP-CRM System.

**Assists with GDPR compliance**
WP-CRM System has optional features, which can assist with GDPR compliance if that is something your business requires. Please note that this plugin does not guarantee GDPR compliance as no plugin can provide 100% compliance. Compliance requires actions on the part of your business that this plugin cannot provide.

Available features include a way for your contacts to view the data that is stored on them in WP-CRM System, the ability for your contacts to export that data, and the ability for contacts to request that their data be deleted.

Not sure what GDPR is or if it applies to your business? [Read our blog post on GDPR](https://www.wp-crm.com/will-your-crm-be-gdpr-compliant/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What makes WP-CRM System different from other CRM's? =
Many other CRM's are hosted on the CRM company's servers, which requires you to maintain an active subscription in order to access YOUR data. WP-CRM System gives you control over your data by keeping it all contained on your WordPress CRM website. You own it all and no one can ever keep you from it - just like it should be. There are no expensive contracts required in order for you to access your customer's information.

= Can I Share Information With Customers? =
Sure! We have a [Client Area](https://www.wp-crm.com/downloads/client-area/?utm_source=extensions&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=client-area&utm_campaign=readme) add-on, which lets you assign projects, tasks, campaigns, and even invoices (with our [Invoicing](https://www.wp-crm.com/downloads/invoicing/?utm_source=extensions&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=invoicing&utm_campaign=readme) add-on) to your contacts. When your contact logs into their account, they'll be able to see everything you're working on for them.

If you need to show your contacts the data that you have on them for GDPR purposes, you will be able to use the GDPR settings to handle this without the need for any additional plugins.

= What if I am coming from another CRM, can I import my data? =
Absolutely. There are inexpensive extensions that allow you to import as little or as much information as you need to into your WordPress CRM.

= Is my data secure? =
Your data is only accessible through the WordPress CRM dashboard. None of it will be accessible through the public facing portion of your website unless you are using our GDPR features (see above). This allows you to provide access to as few or as many people as you need to.
